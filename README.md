# Sentiment-based-Topic-Modeling-on-Social-Media-data
In this project, we are going to collect the tweets of United States stands towards the Ukraine-Russia war. Then, we are going to do some data exploration, generate WordClouds, Named Entity Recognition, perform sentiment analysis using LSTM and create an LDA topic model. ​

The project goal is to use text analytics, LSTM Deep Learning for sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract actionable insights from the tweets and LDA for topic modeling that help the news readers to better understanding of news.​
